#  About me  

**** 
 
***Hello*** My name is Chris

I have a love 💖 and passion for wildlife and tech 💻.  
I have dabbled in code on/off trying to self teach C# with the aim of developing games using Unity and Blender.  

 ***Now*** 💪 feels the right time to make a positive move forward in my coding journey; Which is why i have enrolled on techeducators Full-stack Bootcamp to give me a good foundation which i can then build upon while supporting my learning to become a junior developer .  
In the future i would **LOVE** to build accessible games and apps for those whom live with additional needs. 

On a personnal level i use wildlife 🐦 and nature 🍃 as my therapy and capture this with my camera 📸  
long walks and hours of sitting and waiting listening the sounds of birds, transports me away from all the hussle and bussle of modern life to a place of clarity to allow myself to think.
